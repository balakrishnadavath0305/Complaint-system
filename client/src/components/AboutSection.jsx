              <p>
                <strong>Decentralized Complaint System (DCS)</strong> is an all-in-one platform available 24x7 for
                citizens to lodge complaints related to incomplete or delayed government work. Whether it's local
                municipal issues, land-related concerns, or welfare scheme irregularities, DCS ensures each grievance is
                routed to the correct authority through intelligent role- and location-based access.
              </p>
              <p>
                The platform is integrated with Ministries and Departments across central and state governments, making
                it a unified portal for public service redressal. Each government employee and administrator accesses
                the system based on their assigned sector and area, which ensures faster resolution and better
                accountability.
              </p>
              <p>
                DCS is designed for transparency and user empowerment. Citizens can track the real-time status of their
                complaints, upload photographic or document-based evidence, and receive updates when actions are taken.
                If unsatisfied with the resolution, users can rate the outcome and raise an appeal if needed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Administrators have system-wide visibility â€” they can view all complaints, monitor performance of
                departments, reassign unresolved issues, and ensure that complaints are closed properly with citizen
                feedback.
              </p>
