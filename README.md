# Complaint-system
Its a government complaint rising system similar to CPGRAMS
# Decentralized Government Complaint System

A robust, transparent, and citizen-centric platform for logging, managing, and auditing government complaints. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the project aims to address issues in conventional centralized systemsâ€”improving trust, security, and accountability through decentralization and modern technologies.

## About

This system lets citizens submit complaints about government services, track resolution status, and interact securely with government officials. Using blockchain integration, it also ensures complaint data immutability and traceability, addressing transparency and integrity concerns of traditional systems.

## Features

- Role-based access for citizens, employees, and admins
- Complaint filing and tracking
- Dashboards tailored for each role
- Real-time status updates
- Automatic complaint routing and assignment
- Secure authentication (JWT)
- Optional blockchain anchoring for tamper-proof logs
- Data analytics for admins

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **File Uploads**: Multer
- **Optional**: Blockchain (Ethereum/Polygon)
- **Other**: Docker, cloud deployment strategies


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Optional: Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
